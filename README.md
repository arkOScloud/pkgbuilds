# arkOS Repositories

This repo is for files and software that are used for the production or maintenance of the arkOS distribution.

### PKGBUILDs

PKGBUILD files for forked packages that are modified by arkOS maintainters are stored here. These files are needed by `makepkg` to create repository packages. They are then uploaded to official mirrors from there.

*** EBUILDs

Ebuilds are files used by Portage in order to create and maintain packages.  The method used is to create archlinux packages with Gentoo's Portage.
